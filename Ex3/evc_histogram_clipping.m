% This function is our main function. It executes all functions, that
% were implemented by you, in the correct order.

% ATTENTION: You are not allowed to change this function!

function [newLow, newHigh] = evc_prepare_histogram_range(input, low, high)
%evc_prepare_histogram_range first calculates the new upper- and lower-
% bounds. During the normalization, those two values are then mapped to [0,1].
% If 'low' < 0, it should be set to 0.
% If 'high' > than the maximum intensity in the image, it should be set
% to the maximum intensity.

%   INPUT
%   input 		... image
%   low   		... current black value
%   high  		... current white value

%   OUTPUT
%   newLow      ... new black value
%   newHigh     ... new white value

% TODO:	Implement this function.
% NOTE: The following two lines can be removed. They prevent the
%       framework from crashing.
maximumIntensity =  max(input(:));

end

function [result] = evc_transform_histogram(input, newLow, newHigh)
%evc_transform_histogram performs the 'histogram normalization' and
% maps the interval [newLow, newHigh] to [0, 1].
% IMPORTANT: DON'T use the Matlab functions 'rescale' or 'mat2gray' to do
% this!!!

%   INPUT
%   input 		... image
%   newLow   	... black value
%   newHigh  	... white value

%   OUTPUT
%   result		... image after the histogram normalization

% TODO:	Implement this function.
% HINT: If the current white value is smaller than the maximum intensity
%       of the image, this function will create values larger than 1.
% NOTE: The following line can be removed. It prevents the framework
%       from crashing.

result = (double(input)-newLow)/(newHigh-newLow);

end

function [result] = evc_clip_histogram(img)
% After the transformation of the histogram, evc_clip_histogram sets all
% values that are < 0 to 0 and values that are > 1 to 1.

%   INPUT
%   img 		... image after the histogram normalization

%   OUTPUT
%   result		... image after the clipping operation

% TODO:	Implement this function.
% NOTE: The following line can be removed. It prevents the framework
%       from crashing.
